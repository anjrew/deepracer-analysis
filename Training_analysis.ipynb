    "# Training analysis for DeepRacer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been built based on the `DeepRacer Log Analysis.ipynb` provided by the AWS DeepRacer Team. It has been reorganised and expanded to provide new views on the training data without the helper code which was moved into utility `.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "I have expanded this notebook from to present how I'm using this information. It contains descriptions that you may find not that needed after initial reading. Since this file can change in the future, I recommend that you make its copy and reorganize it to your liking. This way you will not lose your changes and you'll be able to add things as you please.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook isn't complete.** What I find interesting in the logs may not be what you will find interesting and useful. I recommend you get familiar with the tools and try hacking around to get the insights that suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, your ideas are very welcome and encouraged so if you have any suggestions either bring them to [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io) or share as code contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether you're running your training through the console or using the local setup, and on which setup for local training you're using, your experience will vary. As much as I would like everything to be taylored to your configuration, there may be some problems that you may face. If so, please get in touch through [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start using the notebook, you will need to install some dependencies. If you haven't yet done so, have a look at [The README.md file](/edit/README.md#running-the-notebooks) to find what you need to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the install, you also have to configure your programmatic access to AWS. Have a look at the guides below, AWS resources will lead you by the hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Boto Configuration: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to thank [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io) for all the feedback about the notebooks. If you'd like, follow [my blog](https://codelikeamother.uk) where I tend to write about my experiences with AWS DeepRacer.\n",

    "Let's get to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on where you are downloading the data from, you will need some permissions:\n",
    "* Access to CloudWatch log streams\n",
    "* Access to S3 bucket to reach the log files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installs and setups\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using an AWS SageMaker Notebook to run the log analysis, you will need to ensure you install required dependencies. To do that uncomment and run the following:"

    "## Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The original notebook has provided some great ideas on what could be visualised in the graphs. Below examples are a slightly extended version. Let's have a look at what they are presenting and what this may mean to your training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training progress\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have possibly noticed by now, training episodes are grouped into iterations and this notebook also reflects it. What also marks it are checkpoints in the training. After each iteration a set of ckpt files is generated - they contain outcomes of the training, then a model.pb file is built based on that and the car begins a new iteration. Looking at the data grouped by iterations may lead you to a conclusion, that some earlier checkpoint would be a better start for a new training. While this is limited in the AWS DeepRacer Console, with enough disk space you can keep all the checkpoints along the way and use one of them as a start for new training (or even as a submission to a race).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the episodes in a given iteration are a mixture of decision process and random guesses, mean results per iteration may show a specific trend. Mean values are accompanied by standard deviation to show the concentration of values around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rewards per Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see these values as lines or dots per episode in the AWS DeepRacer console. When the reward goes up, this suggests that a car is learning and improving with regards to a given reward function. **This does not have to be a good thing.** If your reward function rewards something that harms performance, your car will learn to drive in a way that will make results worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first the rewards just grow if the progress achieved grows. Interesting things may happen slightly later in the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The reward may go flat at some level - it might mean that the car can't get any better. If you think you could still squeeze something better out of it, review the car's progress and consider updating the reward function, the action space, maybe hyperparameters, or perhaps starting over (either from scratch or from some previous checkpoint)\n",
    "* The reward may become wobbly - here you will see it as a mesh of dots zig-zagging. It can be a gradually growing zig-zag or a roughly stagnated one. This usually means the learning rate hyperparameter is too high and the car started doing actions that oscilate around some local extreme. You can lower the learning rate and hope to step closer to the extreme. Or run away from it if you don't like it\n",
    "* The reward plunges to near zero and stays roughly flat - I only had that when I messed up the hyperparameters or the reward function. Review recent changes and start training over or consider starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard deviation says how close from each other the reward values per episode in a given iteration are. If your model becomes reasonably stable and worst performances become better, at some point the standard deviation may flat out or even decrease. That said, higher speeds usually mean there will be areas on track with higher risk of failure. This may bring the value of standard deviation to a higher value and regardless of whether you like it or not, you need to accept it as a part of fighting for significantly better times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not sure how useful this graph is. I would worry if it looked very similar to the reward graph - this could suggest that slower laps will be getting higher rewards. But there is a better graph for spotting that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Progress per Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph usually starts low and grows and at some point it will get flatter. The maximum value for progress is 100% so it cannot grow without limits. It usually shows similar initial behaviours to reward and time graphs. I usually look at it when I alter an action in training. In such cases this graph usually dips a bit and then returns or goes higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total reward per episode\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph has been taken from the orignal notebook and can show progress on certain groups of behaviours. It usually forms something like a triangle, sometimes you can see a clear line of progress that shows some new way has been first taught and then perfected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean completed lap times per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a model that completes laps reasonably often, we might want to know how fast the car gets around the track. This graph will show you that. I use it quite often when looking for a model to shave a couple more miliseconds. That said it has to go in pair with the last one:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completion rate per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents how big part of all episodes in an iteration is full laps. The value is from range [0, 1] and is a result of deviding amount of full laps in iteration by amount of all episodes in iteration. I say it has to go in pair with the previous one because you not only need a fast lapper, you also want a race completer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Previous graphs were mainly focused on the state of training with regards to training progress. This however will not give you a lot of information about how well your reward function is doing overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such case `scatter_aggregates` may come handy. It comes with three types of graphs:\n",
    "* progress/steps/reward depending on the time of an episode - of this I find reward/time and new_reward/time especially useful to see that I am rewarding good behaviours - I expect the reward to time scatter to look roughly triangular\n",
    "* histograms of time and progress - for all episodes the progress one is usually quite handy to get an idea of model's stability\n",
    "* progress/time_if_complete/reward to closest waypoint at start - these are really useful during training as they show potentially problematic spots on track. It can turn out that a car gets best reward (and performance) starting at a point that just cannot be reached if the car starts elsewhere, or that there is a section of a track that the car struggles to get past and perhaps it's caused by an aggressive action space or undesirable behaviour prior to that place\n",

If your training lasted for five hours, this would show results grouped per each hour.\n",

    "A side note: if you run the function with `category='start_at'` and `groupcount=20` you will get results based on the waypoint closest to the starting point of an episode. If you need to, you can introduce other types of categories and reuse the function.\n",
